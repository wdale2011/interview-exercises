# Personal Questions

These are some common soft questions that you are likely to encounter on an interview.
It will help you a lot to have prepped answers for these so that you can answer in a confident and complete way.

Your assignment today is to answer these questions in interview format with a partner.
If you are the interviewer (the one asking the questions), you will write down your partners responses (perferablly in this MD document, but you can ask your partner for whichever format they prefer).
You don't have to get everything word-for-word, but be detailed enough so that your partner can use these notes as the starting point for a "script".

After you have both answered all of the questions, give each other feedback.
Some things you should be looking for:

1. Body language, especially eye contact and posture
2. Confidence
3. Tone: try to be friendly yet professional. Remember to read the room
4. Conciseness: your answers do not need to be full-on monologues. Get to the point

It may be helpful to also record this feedback in your notes.

After giving feedback, exchange notes.
Your job as the interviewee is to go through these notes and flesh out the responses so that you more or less have a script that you can refer to before any interview.

## 1. Tell me a little about yourself

Note: try to craft a story.
Trace your path that led you to where you are now.
Try to highlight relevant experience such as what got you interested in development, maybe your first project or job/internship.
Also, feel free to bring in a little something outside of the box.
Highlight your "secret sauce," that unique angle or experience that makes you different.

## 2. What value will you bring as a developer?

## 3. What are your strengths? Weaknesses?

## 4. Tell me about some projects you have worked on.

## 5. What are you most proud of?

## 6. Tell me about a challenge or problem you faced in the workplace. How did you overcome it?

## 7. What was your biggest failure (either in coding or in life)? How would you avoid it in the future?

## 8. What is your dream job?

## 9. What are you looking for in this position? What type of work environment do you prefer?

Note: feel free to mention work hours, team size, flexibility (or rigidity) of schedule, management style, office perks, etc...
As well as types of coding (backend v frontend), technologies, or anything else you want.
Be _honest_

## 10. Name a website or app that annoys you. Whatâ€™s wrong with it?

## 11. What do you do when your code breaks?

## 12. If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?

## 13. What do you like to do outside of work?
